## Colour palette:

  * `#bcac40ff, #60bc40ff, #40bc8cff, #4080bcff, #6c40bcff, #bb40bcff, #bc4040ff`

## Notes

  * Abstract description of iCircles and Wilkinson layouts differ
  * Wilkinson allows many disconnected zones.
  * Area labels placed arbitrarily in one of the Wilkinson disconnected zones.
  * Contour labels placed above, above to left, or above to right depending on where they didn't intersect other visual elements.
  * No contours are ever manually moved (even where it would make obvious sense to do so).
  * Prefer to move contour labels outside all contours if possible.
  * In the situation where placing a contour label "nicely" requires  moving an area label to be moved, this is done.

## Undrawable with iCircles

  * q16.zones
  * q21.zones

  * q30.zones is a bit dodgy

## Drawing issues with Wilkinson

  * q17.zones has concurrent contours
  * q29 has a strangly placed contour `Cars`
